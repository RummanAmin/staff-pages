      <h3>Trials Acceleration Programme</h3>
      <p>We launched our Trials Acceleration Programme (TAP) in 2011 with the aim of delivering more life-saving treatments to blood cancer patients in the way of clinical trials.</p>
 
      <p>This involved setting up a network of leading treatment centres around the UK, co-ordinated by a central hub in Birmingham, in a bid to break down the barriers which have slowed down clinical trials and prevented blood cancer patients from getting access to new treatments when they most need them.</p>
       
      <p>We selected 13 treatment centres around the UK and invested £1.3 million into a central hub of expert scientists skilled at setting up and co-ordinating clinical trials to ensure that new trials open at each of the 13 treatment centres, simultaneously.</p>
       
      <p>At the same time, we have invested a further £1 million to ensure that each TAP centre has a dedicated research nurse and data manager to look after patients on our trials and get the results processed more quickly, benefitting patients in the future.</p>
       
      <p>TAP has been an enormous success so far. Nine trials have been set up so far with more scheduled for next year and we are proud about how much of an impact this has had upon the lives of blood cancer patients.</p>

      <h3>What We Fund</h3>
      <p>Get up-to-date information on all of our current research projects and clinical trials using our research project summaries.</p>
 
      <p>Each report summaries new projects, outlining the projects aims and how these met our charitable objectives of improving survival and quality of life for all blood cancer patients.</p>
       
      <p>The summaries are arranged according to the date that they were approved for funding by our Board of Trustees.</p>

      <h4>Finding a specific research project</h4>
 
      <p>To find the summary for a specific research project you’ll need to know when it was approved for funding. If you’re not sure of the a research project’s start date, a full list of all our current research projects and when they were approved can be found on the general server, here:</p>
       
      <p><em>\\Lrfserver\general\Marketing_resource\Research </em></p>

      <p>Once in this folder, go to the spreadsheet titled ‘Active Research Projects’ and select your desired research project from the chronological list. In the second column from the left you’ll find details of the panel meeting at which the project was approved.</p>

      <p>If you don’t have any specific project in mind but would like to see what we are supporting in a particular city, region or research institute, filter the columns to find relevant projects.</p>

      <p>For further information and updates on any of our current projects, please contact <strong>Matt K (237)</strong>.</p>

      <p>Read more about the process of we decide to award funding</p>
